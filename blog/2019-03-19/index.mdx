Let me preface….this is just my experience, thoughts, and opinions. I know every state and county has different rules and regulations. I will not disclose my county due to us still being active in the court system. I speak only from what has happened to us. 

Do you think the court system is there to help families or is it hurting them? I remember my husband telling me that there is another country where they don’t have child support. He said it works because parents aren’t fighting over custody because they aren’t motivated by how much money they will get. The court system likes to say they keep the custody and the money separate. But how? How much custody you have is one of the determinations of how much money you have to pay/get. 

The court system likes to tell you to work it out outside of the court yet when you have an agreement (even written) with your ex they don’t recognize it because you didn’t file it with the court. If you have to use their system and file every agreement how is that keeping it out of the court and promoting parents to work together and trust each other?

You have to pay your attorney anywhere from $1-2000 every time they have to show up in court, depending on your attorney. Then, if the court doesn’t have time to hear your case you are forced to come back and pay another $1-2000 plus a day of missed work/pay. They don’t care if you can’t pay therapists, your lawyer or anyone else. They don’t care that the money you pay gets taken away from the children. Oh sorry kids, we can’t go on vacation this year or get you a new bike because the careless judge didn’t have time for you and just frankly doesn’t care. 

When you go to mediation you have to bring the child(ren) with you to talk to the mediator. They literally ask the kids where they want to live, thus, literally pitting the parents against each other. My stepdaughter has a minor’s counsel. The first time we brought her to meet the minor’s counsel we could overhear their conversation and heard her ask where she preferred to live. By asking them to essentially choose one parent over another they are causing this chaos. 

The court system doesn’t care about you or the children. The judges, mediators, lawyers, therapists/counselors, minor’s counsel, and whoever else gets involved just care about their power and how much money it makes them.
