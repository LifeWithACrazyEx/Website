Today a friend reached out to me and told me she and her husband were starting the whole custody process in court. I was shocked. They had been married for at least 20 years and have two teenage boys. She was asking for my advice/input into my experience with the court system.

It made me think about how we really cannot judge or pretend to know what someone else’s situation is. I have learned from being on the dad’s side of the story that I cannot just assume the dad/boyfriend/husband is being a dick/deadbeat/bad guy. We have been through the wringer with the crazy ex. After she had my husband falsely arrested for threatening domestic violence I really knew I couldn’t just hear a woman’s side, friend or not, and just believe their side to the story. When the whole #metoo movement started it was around the time after my husband was falsely accused. I couldn’t just sit there and assume that any celebrity had actually done what the woman or women accused them of. I was not in the room with them. I did not see the texts or emails. Who am I to just vilify a man based on a woman’s word. It’s sad that there are true victims out there but for all the victims there are also women lying to get what they want, whether that be their ex out of the kids' life or their 15 min of fame. 

So today as I listened or more read the messages from my friend come in I had to really tell myself while I want to support her and be there for her, I don’t know the role she plays in her situation. I can’t just assume her ex is a dick or just wants more time so he can pay less child support. Everything I hear is also stuff that has been said about my husband and it couldn’t further from the truth. So, I ask that before you just judge a person based on another person's interpretation that you step back, listen, be a good friend but don’t assume that they are the innocent victim.
