Who is this infamous ex I talk about? I guess I should share a little about her. My husband and her met when he was 18 and she was 22. They were together a total of 8 years, married only 4.  Most of their relationship was being somewhat apart because they were both in college and living in different places at different times. They got married in 2003. My husband tells me they fought while on their honeymoon and even before they got married my in-laws and other members of my husband’s family were telling him not to marry her. 

She was, and still is, a very spoiled, selfish princess who thought she was and is entitled to everything. Her parents didn’t say no to her. I remember a story my father in-law tells me that the ex’s dad ate part of her muffin one time and she threw such a fit she made him go buy her another one...and he did!

They went to therapy and couples counseling and my husband almost left her many times and then, her dad died. It always seemed poor timing for him. Throughout their marriage the ex would be emotionally and physically abusive toward my husband. She exhibited signs of borderline personality disorder. Even therapists my husband talked to said it sounded like she could be borderline. She would tell my husband she hated him and then shortly after say she loved him. She would throw things at him if she was mad. Every therapist they saw would called her out for being a “princess”  and she would quit on them. She could only keep up her act for so long before people realized how unstable she was and once they would say something she was done with them.  

The ex really wanted a baby. After trying for 2 years and during a time when they were almost getting divorced she found out she was pregnant. Three months into the pregnancy my husband just couldn’t take the abuse any longer, so he left.  Finding out she was pregnant was the last thing he or their relationship needed and I guess you could say it was the straw that broke the camel’s back. We all know bringing a child into an abusive unstable relationship is never ideal. My husband moved out and then she filed for divorce...
