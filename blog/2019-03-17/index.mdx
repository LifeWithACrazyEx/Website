I was thinking this morning to myself….why now? Why did I wait so long to start this blog. I have been living 10+ years dealing with this crazy, that in itself is crazy. 

In the past 2 years it has become worse.  We had stayed out of court and kept quiet for 6 years. When we saw how alienated we really were we took a stand and fought back. Writing things down was a way to keep track but also served as a means to get the crazy out of my head.  The thoughts/conversations consume so much of me that I needed a way to get them out but also to remember what happened in case we needed it. 

I originally thought I would someday write a book. But, recently we went back to court and got the reality check that the system isn’t going to help us and doesn’t care that the ex lies, even when they call her a lier. This realization sent myself and my husband into a depression. A sick feeling that while we struggle to survive, emotionally and financially she will continue to get away with everything. 

This is why now. I needed to put what my life has been like out there, if nothing else to serve as an outlet of therapy for myself. It’s giving me a new purpose and even if one person reads this then I have done what I can do to help. This is serving as a means to take back my life, my families life and my feelings. 


Yours Truly,
